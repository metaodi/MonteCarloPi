# Abstract

This is a simple implementation to approximate the number Pi using a so called Monte Carlo simulation. The idea behind Monte Carlo is to approximate hard problems using random data. The assumption is, that it is an easy problem to calculate something exactly if we already have sample data. Using random data and a large amount of iterations we can make approximations about the result. 

This program is using [the darts on circle/square idea](http://www.chem.unl.edu/zeng/joy/mclab/mcintro.html) as an example of Monte Carlo.
